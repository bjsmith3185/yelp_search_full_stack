# yelp_search_full_stack
this app will search yelp API and display results as a list, map or both.

This is a full stack app that uses: node, express, handlebars and SQL.
It has 2 API's, Yelp and Google Maps.

How it works:
 - The user will enter a restaurant name in the search field.
 - The result can be displayed on either a map, list or both, the default is both.
 - The location of the restaurant is available on a map (Google Maps API).
 - A review of the restaurnt is available (Yelp API).

All user searches are listed but can be removed on the "combo" page.

This was my first attempt at a full stack project using SQL as well as Handlebars.JS

It was deployed to Heroku.
